#Heart o Gold

Heart o Gold is a text adventure engine that follows a Choose Your Own Adventure format. Currently it is built in Python, but I am working on moving it to D.

##The Engine

While many would argue that at this stage, it is not an engine, I am planning on several things to add to it to make it an invaluable resource. See TODO for more details.

###Current Features
The only features so far implemented are "Scenes"and navigating between them along with basic key binding.

####Examples
The included examples are two games I made in the original Python: ERROR and Christmas Time. They are made with versions Annabelle and Bethany respectively.
